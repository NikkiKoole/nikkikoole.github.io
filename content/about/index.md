# This is me

Here's a picture of me—the older one sporting a mustache—together with my two boys. ;) Picture taken a few years ago.

I am building **good apps for children** because well, there just aren't enough of them.

If you settle for nasty, exploitative apps for your children that turn them into mindless consumers, you have got over 3.7 billion options.
However, ~~truly good~~ not shit, handcrafted, jazzy interactive playthings that is not bad for children is pretty rare.

**That is what we are making**.

– Nikki

(Oh and PS, if you know other good apps like that, please send me a mail)
