# This is me

The older one with the mustache together with my 2 boys.

Once a talented artist, now a front end developer. 
With bigger dreams though.


Anyway, I am building **better apps for children** because, most of them, at least the ones Theo finds, suck hard. There are nice ones out there, but they look too generic. There are good-looking ones, but they don't feel great. Then there are even better ones, but they feel dumb somehow. And then there is the vast majority that just tries to throw in as many advertisements and micro-payments as possible.

I believe I can do much better and it's a great medium combining drawing, animating, programming, musicmaking, storytelling, worldbuilding and problemsolving  all in one.

The first app is finished, and more apps are on the way.
Theo and Herman are helping, and sometimes even the HP envy scanner is cooperative.
