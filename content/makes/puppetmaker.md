Create your own Mipo with Mipo Puppetmaker!

Mipos are weird and wonderful creatures. They're hairy, they love jumping, bouncing, and making peculiar noises. Some of them are enormous, while others are kind of small. They come in all the colors of the rainbow.

You can have them play in an outdoor space, annoy them, and even make them enjoy a big pile of wine gums!

## No adds
## No micro transactions
## completely *FREE*

Upcoming updates maybe introduce clothes, but for now, they enjoy  being naked and just hairy, some bald.

## making of

This app started with this simple drawing
![ingame](../assets/images/doggie.png)

A nice drawing, I still think.
But as a character in an app it has some issues.
It needs to be animating, and it's very handdrawn.
Also it's quite a high resolution.
This could easily end up becoming way too much data per character
So i opted for *building* a character instead.

The logical thing would be to build this character again.
Instead i just started making dozens and dozens of small bodyparts.
Added a  user interface to experiment coloring and patterning them.

And then after some time, got worried that this was just another time of me procastinating finishing an app.
So I decided that this character building tool was going to be my first app.

The handdrawn aspect of it was going to be leading in the design.
It's finished and you can download it for free.
However, it will probably grow as it's being used for further apps...
