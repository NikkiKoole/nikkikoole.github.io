He knows all the minute details on various rollercoasters world-wide.
And he's been making great drawings of them.   

At some point I figured I wanted to help him make these drawings come to life.
So we've been making a little 2d rollercoaster game thingie. 

The weirdest issue i had thinkng about it was how to solve the issue where you are drawing a 2d thing and it has some 3d properties, notably the flipping parts / or screws. 
It's solved very simple, so that is nice.

The thing is very much not illustrated (yet)  
Let's see where it goes.
