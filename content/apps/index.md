Did you dream about toys coming to life when not looking?

I know I did. I had my little figurines in my school desk, pretending they were living there in a little room. Once, Miss Coby asked me all about it.

Anyway, now I am all grown up, and I don't dream about that anymore unless it's in a dream. It doesn't happen when I'm not looking (I think). It takes a whole lot of effort to make toys come to life.
