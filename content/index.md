## Hello, my name is Nikki 

Once a talented artist, now a front end developer.  
But I got dreams.  
And they make me go mad.  

Anyway, I am building **better** child apps,  
There are nice ones out there, but they look too generic.  
There are good looking ones, but they don't feel great.  
There are even better ones, but they feel dumb somehow.  

I know children, matter of fact, bit of a big one myself and I love developing, drawing, animating and making music.  
So I feel I can do better.  

I've been working for quite some time on tooling (an animation tool, a vector drawing tool, a music making tool)  
Now I feel the procrastination phase is done, and apps need to end up in the app store before soon.




So let's introduce some deadlines,  
and let's make them thight.  
See that calendar above? I'll be adding deadlines as we go.  
Pumping out apps, one per month, the first deadline is about this website, I'll be writing here about my process, and need a place where I can keep track about other stuff too. 

End of the month this website will be live, and sice I am quite far already and I also need some extra work for all other apps, I'll add 'figuring out how to deploy apps and do a test run' to the first deadline too.
