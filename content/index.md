## name mipolai
Alright, where does the name Mikolai come from, and why is your website named that way? When I was around four years old, I had a friend named Nicolai. I couldn't pronounce his name correctly and ended up saying "mipolai" instead. Even though my friend's actual name wasn't that, I found it to be the most beautiful name I had ever heardâ€”Mipolai. As for myself, my name is Nikki, and I also struggled with pronunciation, becoming "Nitti." For years, the name Mipolai stayed with me, a fantastic name that I even considered giving to my future children. I named my stuffed animal Mipolai, but eventually, I forgot about it. I stopped playing with stuffed animals and learned to pronounce names as they were intended, and the decades passed.

When it came time to come up with a name for this website and my future company, about 35 years since Nitti and Mipolai, after creating endless lists of uninspiring and mediocre names, I suddenly recalled this memory. And then, you just know that it feels right. In essence, that name doesn't hold any specific meaning, but as a small four-year-old, I considered it the most beautiful name I knew.


## what are we doing here
Alright, what are we doing here, what is this website, and what are the goals?

Hey, great to have you here! Mipolai creates apps for children, exceptionally creative apps for kids, if I may say so myself. It may sound a tad cheesy to boast about it, but I genuinely believe they are superior apps for children. They are apps crafted with a personal touch, infused with that thing they call "intrinsic motivation" back in art school. We, as creators, have a deep passion for creativity, and for my own children, I wanted to offer more than the typical apps I often come across. Apart from everything else out there, we are makers, driven by love for our craft. Simply put, we create apps here with love for children.

And just to make it clear, these apps are ad-free and free from microtransactions. They are made with love and are available at an affordable price. I'm thrilled that you've come here to explore.


## What have i done
Alright, what have I created, why, and where do I hope it goes?

The first creation here is PuppetMaker, born out of my inherent laziness to draw numerous characters. So, I thought, why not create an app to assist in drawing characters? I hope you find them looking delightful and enjoyable.

Next up, there's a world being crafted for these puppets to play in. I don't want to reveal too much at this point since it's still a work in progress, subject to change. However, I envision it involving bicycles or tricycles in some way.

Speaking of ambition and discussing future plans, I must admit it's quite a challenge. Take this very website, for instance. It has been live for a couple of months now, and from the beginning, I kept a calendar with the wonderfully ambitious goal of launching a new app every month. However, after missing several deadlines, I decided to let go of that pressure. I'm still figuring out the rhythm of creating new apps. Perhaps after two or three more apps, I'll be able to share more details.



## Hello, my name is Nikki 


Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm a one-man show on a mission to create playful and engaging apps for children.

As a solo developer, I'm able to pour all of my care and attention into each of my projects. My goal is to create apps that not only entertain kids, but also help them learn and grow in meaningful ways.

I think play is a crucial part of childhood, and I strive to make every one of my apps a joyful and memorable experience for kids. From interactive stories and lovable characters, to educational games that are actually fun to play, I'm constantly pushing myself to come up with new and exciting ideas.

Thanks for stopping by and considering my apps for your family. I hope they bring as much joy to your kids as they do to me while I'm creating them.

##Mipolai what even does that mean ?

Okay, where does the name Mipolai come from and why is your website called that? 
When I was about four years old, I had a friend named Nicolai. 
I couldn't pronounce his name correctly, so I called him "Mipolai." 
Even though my friend's actual name wasn't like that, I thought it was the most beautiful name I had ever heard: Mipolai. 
My own name is Nikki, but I couldn't pronounce it either, so it became "Nitti." I remembered that name, Mipolai, for years. It was a fantastic name, and I even planned to name my future children that. I named my stuffed animal Mipolai as well, but eventually, I forgot about it. 

I stopped playing with stuffed animals and could pronounce names as they were intended, and decades went by. Then, about 35 years after Nitti and Mipolai, when I had to come up with a name for this website and my future company, after making endless lists of uninspired and mediocre names, I suddenly recalled this memory. And just like that, you know you've found the **right** name. That name doesn't actually mean anything on its own, but as a little four-year-old, I thought it was the most beautiful name I knew.

Once a talented artist, now a front end developer.
I got bigger dreams though.
And they make me go mad.

Anyway, I am building **better** children apps,
There are nice ones out there, but they look too generic.
There are good looking ones, but they don't feel great.
There are even better ones, but they feel dumb somehow.

Once a talented artist, now a front end developer.

Anyway, I am building **better** children apps,
There are nice ones out there, but they look too generic.
There are good looking ones, but they don't feel great.
There are even better ones, but they feel dumb somehow.
And then there is the vast majority that just tries to throw in as many advertisements and micro-payments as possible.

I know children, matter of fact, bit of a big one myself and I love developing, drawing, animating and making music.
So I believe, I can do better.

I've been working for quite some time on tooling (an animation tool, a vector drawing tool, a music making tool)
Now I feel the procrastination phase is done (ha ha sure), and apps need to end up in the app store before soon.


So let's introduce some deadlines,
and let's make them tight.
See that calendar above? I'll be adding deadlines as we go.
Pumping out apps, one per month, or well the first deadline is about this website, I'll be writing here about my process, and need a place where I can keep track about other stuff too.
