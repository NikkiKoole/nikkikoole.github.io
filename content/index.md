# Tablets and phones are great tools for kids.

 <div class='banner'>CRAP FREE</div>

 But too many apps are made to fill their minds with ads and craps,
 that is why

# Nikki Koole *and sons* create good apps for children!

 Apps you don‚Äôt have to worry about.
 No ads. No gimmicks, No tricks.
 Handcrafted with artistic care and an old-school respect for childhood: creative, safe, and a bit weird (in the good way).

I bounce around quite a bit,

That's why you may call me ball.

I am just a silly guy
and don't really care at all.

Hairs on my knees,
Butterflies and bees,
Love me a hill of wine gums, please,

My legs are sometimes tangled,
And my belly bingle bengled.

Like me, there are many,
But we are all unique.

We have hairs and funky pieces,
Round or skinny, various faeces,
A huge enormous bulb of hairyness,

Or a tiny bumpy ball.

A glorious Mipo to you all.

# You know that tablet your children are glued too?
The amount of crap apps on there is staggering.
I want to make a change.

- no excessive monetization tricks
- no pretend to be educational
- no uninspired cookie cutter crap
- no countless advertisements
- no ugly looking ill designed things
- no to the rabbit hole of endless other crap.

Children are not stupid, and we shouldn't train them into stupid either.

- yes to handdrawn and animated silly stuff
- yes to home crafted music
- yes to contributions of my own boys
- yes to all sorts of things to discover
- yes to being educational without being boring about it
- yes to subtle and not so subtle jokes
- yes to funkyness
