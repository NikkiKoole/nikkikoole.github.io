## Hello, my name is Nikki 


Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm a one-man show on a mission to create playful and engaging apps for children.

As a solo developer, I'm able to pour all of my care and attention into each of my projects. My goal is to create apps that not only entertain kids, but also help them learn and grow in meaningful ways.

I think play is a crucial part of childhood, and I strive to make every one of my apps a joyful and memorable experience for kids. From interactive stories and lovable characters, to educational games that are actually fun to play, I'm constantly pushing myself to come up with new and exciting ideas.

Thanks for stopping by and considering my apps for your family. I hope they bring as much joy to your kids as they do to me while I'm creating them.

Once a talented artist, now a front end developer.
I got bigger dreams though.
And they make me go mad.

Anyway, I am building **better** children apps,
There are nice ones out there, but they look too generic.
There are good looking ones, but they don't feel great.
There are even better ones, but they feel dumb somehow.

Once a talented artist, now a front end developer.

Anyway, I am building **better** children apps,
There are nice ones out there, but they look too generic.
There are good looking ones, but they don't feel great.
There are even better ones, but they feel dumb somehow.
And then there is the vast majority that just tries to throw in as many advertisements and micro-payments as possible.

I know children, matter of fact, bit of a big one myself and I love developing, drawing, animating and making music.
So I believe, I can do better.

I've been working for quite some time on tooling (an animation tool, a vector drawing tool, a music making tool)
Now I feel the procrastination phase is done (ha ha sure), and apps need to end up in the app store before soon.


So let's introduce some deadlines,
and let's make them tight.
See that calendar above? I'll be adding deadlines as we go.
Pumping out apps, one per month, or well the first deadline is about this website, I'll be writing here about my process, and need a place where I can keep track about other stuff too.
