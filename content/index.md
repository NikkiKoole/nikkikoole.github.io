## Hello, my name is Nikki

Once a talented artist, now a front end developer. I got bigger dreams though. And they make me go mad.

Anyway, I am building **better** children apps, Sure there are nice ones out there, but they look too generic. There are good looking ones, but they don't feel great. There are even better ones, but they feel dumb somehow. And then there is the vast majority that just tries to throw in as many advertisements and micro-payments as possible. 

I know children, as a matter of fact, I'm a bit of a big one myself, and I love developing, drawing, animating, fantasizing, philosophizing, playing chess, and making music. So I believe I can do better.

~~So let's introduce some deadlines, and let's make them tight. See that calendar here? I'll be adding deadlines as we go. Pumping out apps, one per month, or well the first deadline is about this website~~,  Ok so instead of these deadlines, I'll just use this calendar to keep track of stuff that has been started and finished..

<section class='yellow'>
<div class='put-calendar-in-here'></div>
<script>
    //remember month counting starts from 0
	let deadlines = [
        {date:new Date(2022, 9, 1), description: 'started working on the website', success:true},
        {date:new Date(2022, 9, 31), description: 'website live', success:true},
        {date:new Date(2022, 10, 1), description: 'started working on puppetmaker', success:true},
        {date:new Date(2023, 5, 10), description: 'puppetmaker in app store!', success:true},
        {date:new Date(2023, 5, 13), description: 'started working on next thing', success:true}
        ];
	buildCalendar(deadlines);
</script>

</section>
