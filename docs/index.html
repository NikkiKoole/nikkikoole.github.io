<h1>Nikki Koole and sons</h1>
<h2>making apps</h2>

<h2>Hello, my name is Nikki</h2>

<p>Once a talented artist, now a front end developer. I got bigger dreams though. And they make me go mad.</p>

<p>Anyway, I am building <strong>better</strong> children apps, Sure there are nice ones out there, but they look too generic. There are good looking ones, but they don't feel great. There are even better ones, but they feel dumb somehow. And then there is the vast majority that just tries to throw in as many advertisements and micro-payments as possible. </p>

<p>I know children, as a matter of fact, I'm a bit of a big one myself, and I love developing, drawing, animating, fantasizing, philosophizing, playing chess, and making music. So I believe I can do better.</p>

<p><del>So let's introduce some deadlines, and let's make them tight. See that calendar here? I'll be adding deadlines as we go. Pumping out apps, one per month, or well the first deadline is about this website</del>,  Ok so instead of these deadlines, I'll just use this calendar to keep track of stuff that has been started and finished..</p>

<p>I bounce around quite a bit, <br/>
That's why they call me ball. <br/>
I am a crazy oddity, <br/>
And just don't care at all.  </p>

<p>Hairs on my knees, <br/>
Butterflies and bees, <br/>
Love me a hill of wine gums, please, <br/>
When the time comes to feast.  </p>

<p>My legs are sometimes tangled, <br/>
And my torso is pattern spangled, <br/>
Falling often is the best solution, <br/>
And I don't care for some confusion.  </p>

<p>At the start, I said I just don't care, <br/>
That was a lie, because I often do. <br/>
I care for things and people and places. <br/>
And I kinda deeply care for you.  </p>

<p>Like me, there are many, <br/>
But we are all unique. <br/>
We are men, women, something beastly, <br/>
And something right there in between.  </p>

<p>We have hairs and funky bends, <br/>
Round or skinny, tall or small, <br/>
A huge enormous ball of happiness, <br/>
Or a tiny bump of joy.  </p>
