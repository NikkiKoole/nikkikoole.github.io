Wiiiehaaaa, here are the Mipos! And you can make them yourself too!</p>

<p>Here is this fantastic tool that lets you create a character you'll adore. It'll moan, humf, fart, and breathe while you build it. After that, you can unleash it to play with your other ones in a sandbox. Call it whimsical, I guess, but I simply call them Mipo.What they are exactly you ask? Well You didn't ask, but I like this style so I'll pretend.</p>

<p>Mipos are creatures, somewhere between humans, animals, and monsters. A vast collection of hand-drawn body parts, in many colors and patterns, is still growing for you to combine and make them yourself. Oh yeah, the Mipos are a weird bunch, coming in all sorts of shapes and sizes – hairy, furry, feathery, bald, you name it. They don't have genders but could have a bunch of body hair still so yeah.</p>

<p>Create cute ragdoll characters for a sandbox designed for kids, also suitable for preschool-aged children (3-5). With the Mipo Character Creator aka Puppetmaker, you can unleash your creation into a whimsical sandbox, offering endless possibilities for exploration and play. Join these charming oddballs in their world, where they come in all shapes, sizes, and colors, indulging in activities like jumping, handstands, tickling, and even enjoying wine gums. </p>

<p>Explore a diverse collection of hand-drawn (I took many trips to the art supply store to get the exact type of pencil and ink) body parts to mix and match, shaping a truly one-of-a-kind Mipo. Now, what is a Mipo, you might wonder? It's a creature that defies categorization – not human, not an animal, nor a monster. Instead, it's something in between, a unique being that emits delightful noises. From huge to small, hairy to bald, and even featuring feathers, Mipos come in a variety of colors and patterns, forming a wonderfully diverse bunch.
